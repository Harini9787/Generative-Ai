Image Classification README
Overview
This README file provides information and instructions for using the image classification model.

Model Description
The image classification model is a deep learning model trained to classify images into predefined categories or classes. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn features from input images and make predictions based on those features.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model implementation)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
Pretrained model weights (if using a pretrained model)
Usage
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies mentioned above.

Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset for classification. Ensure that your dataset is organized into appropriate directories, such as one directory per class, or a CSV file with image paths and corresponding labels.

Model Training:

If you want to train the model from scratch:
Implement the CNN architecture suitable for your task.
Prepare your dataset for training.
Train the model using your dataset.
If you want to use a pre-trained model:
Download the pre-trained weights (if not provided) or load them from a library like TensorFlow Hub or Hugging Face.
Fine-tune the pre-trained model on your dataset if necessary.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation or test dataset.
Compute relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Inference:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
Preprocess the images (resize, normalization, etc.) as required by the model.
Pass the preprocessed images through the model and obtain predictions.
Post-process the predictions if necessary (e.g., apply thresholding, interpret probabilities).
Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model in your preferred deployment environment (e.g., cloud service, edge device).
Expose the model through an API endpoint for making predictions.
Implement necessary security measures to protect the model and data.
